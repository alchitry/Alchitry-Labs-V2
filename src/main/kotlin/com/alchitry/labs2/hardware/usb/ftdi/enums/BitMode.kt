/**
 * Enumerated list of Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE) bitbang modes.
 *
 *
 * BIT BANG MODE: FT232R and FT245R chips can be set up in a special mode where the normal function of the chips are replaced. This mode changes the 8 data lines on the
 * FT245BM or the RS232 data and control lines of the FT232BM to an 8 bit bi-directional bus. The purpose of this mode was intended to be used to program FPGA devices. It may
 * also be used to talk to serial EEPPROMs or load a data latch.
 *
 *
 * For the data to change, there has to be new data written and the baud clock has to tick. If you do not write any new data to the device then the pins will hold the last
 * value written.
 *
 *
 * The commands of interest are :
 *
 *
 * 1) FT_SetBaudRate(ftHandle : Dword ; BaudRate : Dword) : FT_Result; This controls the rate of transferring bytes that have been written to the device onto the pins. It also
 * sets the sampling of the pins and transferring the result back to the Read path of the chip. The maximum baud rate is 3 MegaBaud. The clock for the Bit Bang mode is
 * actually 16 times the baudrate. A value of 9600 baud would transfer the data at (9600 x 16) = 153600 bytes per second or 1 every 6.5 uS.
 *
 *
 * 2) FT_SetBitMode (ftHandle : Dword ; ucMask , ucEnable : Byte) : FT_Result; This sets up which bits are input and which are output. The ucMask byte sets the direction. A
 * ‘1’ means the corresponding bit is to be an output. A ‘0’ means the corresponding bit is to be an input. When read data is passed back to the PC, the current pin state for
 * both inputs and outputs will used. The ucEnable byte will turn the bit bang mode off and on. Setting bit 0 to ‘1’ turns it on. Clearing bit 0 to ‘0’ turns it off.
 *
 *
 * 3) FT_GetBitMode ( ftHandle : Dword ; pucData : pointer ) : FT_Result; This function does an immediate read of the 8 pins and passes back the value. This is useful to see
 * what the pins are doing now. The normal Read pipe will contain the same result but it has also been sampling the pins continuously (up until its buffers become full).
 * Therefor the data in the Read pipe will be old.
